        <h2>Where to Live</h2>
        <p>There are several housing options available for students:</p>
        <p>keep in mind that there is no commission for finding houses</p>
        <p>
          there will be initial applicaton fee, you'll be asked to pay the first
          month rent, last month rent and security deposit(it will be refunded
          at the end)
        </p>
        <p>
            yes, you can share a room with another person, but they have to be added in the lease document. this may cost additional $50 on the rent.
            but it is safe to include them in the lease document. If the managmant gets to know they you had a person living under the same roof, without having them on the lease, 
            will lead to fine or termination of the lease. (yes this happened, the fine was huge, then they had to vacate the house)
          </p>
        <p>
          there are mainly 3 official Drexel affiliated housing ü§Æ Chestnut

        </ul>
        <h3>things to consider while looking for a appartments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity to Drexel University</strong> Consider how close
            the apartment is to the Drexel University campus. Living within
            walking distance or a short commute can save time on transportation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safety</strong> Research the safety of the neighborhood.
            Look for low crime rates and safe streets. there are police patrol
            in some aras
          </li>
          <li>
            most of the studnts live in Powelton, Pearl St, Baring St, Hamilton
            St, Spring Garden St (I lived here), Brandywine St and Haverford
            Ave. Try to stay within 39 th street, it gets shady beond this
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rental Costs</strong> Determine your budget and look for
            apartments that fit within it. Consider not only the rent but also
            utilities (water, electricity, internet) which may or may not be
            included. I lived in 3bed, 3bath, I paid $630 only for rent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Furnished vs. Unfurnished</strong> Decide if you prefer a
            furnished or unfurnished apartment. Furnished apartments may be
            convenient for international students who don't want to buy
            furniture immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Services and Shops</strong> Look for nearby grocery
            stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and other essential services.
            Convenience can make daily life easier.
